# SEC555 - SIEM with Tactical Analytics

## Welcome to SEC555!

![Cyber Defense](CyberDefense_logo.jpg)

### **`SEC555 Portal Version: 2.0.0`**

The goal of the SEC555 wiki is to provide knowledge to the security community. As one gets better we all get better! As such this is a free source of cyber defense information primarily around Security Information Event Management (SIEM) systems.

The other goal is for **SEC555: SIEM with Tactical Analytics** students and is to increase the **in-class**, and, most importantly, **after-class** value of the course material. It is also designed as a method to give back to the security community by providing free information. This wiki is, and likely always will be, very much a work in progress.

Contained in the wiki, you will find:

- Tool and technique cheat sheets
- Reference guides
- Information about 555 instructors
- Electronic Copies of the Lab Guides (**copy and paste, FTW!!!**) (**Digital labs are only available on student VM - SEC555 course attendees only**)
...and more

Note: If you are using the student VM included when taking SEC555 you have the capability of turning on automatic wiki/lab updating.

### Recommendations - PLEASE READ

There are two things that are **highly recommended** to do before diving in.

1. **Discover how to use the Smart Player**. Videos are played using Smart Player and there are some features you may not know exist without checking [out this guide](/Resources/SmartPlayer/). The videos created in the wiki took a tremendous amount of time to put together due to adding many features that Smart Player allows such as searching for any word spoken by the presenter and jumping to that section of the video.
2. If you are a SEC555 student, **enable automatic updates of the wiki and lab content**

### How to manually update the wiki

To manually update the wiki content run the command below.

```bash
sudo /bin/bash /scripts/wiki_up.sh
```
